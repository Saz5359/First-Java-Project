# My first Java project

## This is the second project of my bootcamp which instructs us to create a food delivery system. 
The system receives orders and distributes them to a driver based on their current load and their location. The customer orders from any location and the program finds a driver
that is available in the area. If there is a driver in availabe in the customers location then an invoice is created for the customer as a text file to let them know that their order is on its 
way and if there is no driver in the location then a invoice is created to tell the the customer that their are no drivers available.
This program stores the following information for each customer:
+ Order number
+ Customer name
+ Contact number of the customer
+ Address of the customer
+ Location (city) of the customer
+ Email address of the customer
+ Name of the restaurant
+ Location of the restaurant
+ Contact number of the restaurant
+ How many of each meal is being ordered
+ The list of meals being ordered and their prices
+ Any special preparation instructions given by the customer
+ The total amount to be paid

The program uses the information to locate a driver and create an invoice.

This project shows my skills as a Java develpoer as it was created using:
+ JAVA 

## How to install project
This is a simple program which requires a text editor and console
+ Copy all files to a folder
+ Make sure all folders are copied
+ Run the project in the command prompt or console
+ The project requires some space for the invoice which is a text file
